A Strategy Game in Space

This game has been written a few years ago, and since i don't have time to complete it, i decided to release it under LGPL. 
It uses Bass.dll for audio and OpenGL as output. The rendering class is quite abstract and can easily changed to 
Firemonkey or GDI.



A project is being updated to be an fmx platform course
  currently focusing on building the game for Android. 
Any help is welcome
